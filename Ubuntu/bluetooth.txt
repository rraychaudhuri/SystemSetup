This is one option tht fixed my bluetooth once

# Install stuff
sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol bluez


# restart bluetooth services

service bluetooth restart
sudo killall pulseaudio

# Check status
service bluetooth status


# Remove the Bluetooth Device first from the system then reconnect

Now checking status again will show an extra line saying the device got connected
Now bluetooth should be fixed
